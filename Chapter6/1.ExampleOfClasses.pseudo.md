### Student

Here is a sample class called student
```
Class Student:
  name
  rollnumber
  gpa := 0
  subjectsInGPA := 0

  Method setName(name):
    this.name = name
  END

  Method addToGPA(newScore):
    this.gpa = (this.gpa*this.subjectsInGPA + newScore)/(this.subjectsInGPA + 1)
    this.subjectsInGPA = this.subjectsInGPA + 1
  END

  Method getGPA():
    return this.gpa
  END
END

```

In this class, there are 4 characteristics of the student - name, roll number, the students GPA and a number of subjects the student has completed.

### Instantiation
```
Student paul = new Student()
Student peter = new Student()
```
In the above, we are constructing two objects of the class Student and naming then paul and peter. The name we give to the object in our program should not be confused to the "name" attribute in the Class. We will set that below.

### Applying methods on objects
```
paul.setName("Paul Jones") # Object is called paul in our program, but paul.name is set to "Paul Jones"
peter.setName("Peter Pan")

paul.addToGPA(4) # if you used "Paul Jones".addToGPA, this would create an error
paul.addToGPA(3)

peter.addToGPA(3)
peter.addToGPA(2)


```

In a simple set method like setName, we are showing how you can alter the state of an object. In addToGPA, we show how the methods of the class can use complex logic to alter its own state. The input is used to update not just the GPA but the count of subjects taken by the student. This way the object has all the information needed when the next score is passed. Other objects interacting with this object need not know the count of subjects completed by this student to alter the state.

In getGPA we have a method that does not alter the state, but purely provides a way to read the state of the object.
