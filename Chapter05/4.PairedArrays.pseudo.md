### Paired Arrays

In the following snippet, there are two arrays, one for price codes and another for applicable discount rate when that price code is set to an item.

When we have to find the discount rate given a price code, we iterate through the priceCodes array till we find the price code that has been input, and we return the discountRate at that index.


```
priceCodes = ['H', 'F', 'T', 'Q', 'Z' ];
discountRate = [0.5, 0.4, 0.33, 0.25, 0.0];

Get_Discount_Rate (priceCode)
    index = 1
    DOWHILE (index <= 5)
        IF (priceCodes[index] == priceCode)
            return discountRate[index]
        ENDIF
        index = index + 1
    ENDDO
    // Default discount is 0% if price code not found
    return 0
END
```

### Exercise

Can you manipulate the above to have variable size of priceCodes and discountRates?
