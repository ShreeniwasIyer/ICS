### Sum Of Elements in an Array

The following algorithm involve the simple manipulation of an array written in a DO loop. In this example, each element of the array is accumulated into a variable called sum. When all elements have been added, the variable sum is printed


```
Input elements
Set sum = 0
Set index = 1
Set length = length(elements)
DOWHILE (index < = length)
		sum = sum + elements (index)
		index = index + 1
ENDDO
```

### Exercise

Can you write the above algorithm using REPEAT UNTIL and/or DO?
