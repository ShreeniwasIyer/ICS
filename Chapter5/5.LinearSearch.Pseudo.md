### Linear Search

The following example illustrates linear search of an array

```
Linear_search_of_an_array
  	Set max_num_elements to required value
  	Set element_found to false
    index = 1
  	DOWHILE (NOT element_found) AND (index <= max_num_elements)
    		IF array (index) = input_value THEN
    			 Set element_found to true
    		ELSE
    			 index = index +1
    		ENDIF
  	ENDDO
  	IF element_found THEN
  		  Print array (index)
  	ELSE
  		  Print ‘value not found’, input_value
  	ENDIF
END
```

### Exercise

A Binary Search is defined as a search algorithm where given an input of sorted elements (i.e. Array is in ascending or descending order), we look at the middle element and see if the middle element is the element we are searching for (Answer Found!), greater than the number (we need the search the left side of the middle), or less than the number (search the right side of middle). Can you modify the above to write out binary search?
