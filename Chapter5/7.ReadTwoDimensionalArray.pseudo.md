### Inputing multi-dimensional arrays

```
PRINT 'Enter number of movies’
READ movieCount from keyboard
PRINT 'Enter number of users’
READ userCount from keyboard

DECLARE rating as two dimensional array of int[userCount][movieCount]

SET user = 1
REPEAT
SET movie = 1
REPEAT // Nested Loop
	PRINT 'Enter user’ + user + ‘’s rating for movie' + movie
	READ input from the keyboard
	rating[user][movie] = input
UNTIL input = '*'
User = user + 1
UNTIL user > userCount
```

### Exercise

Use a similar nested loop to calculate the average ratings each user has given to movies (s)he has reviewed. Also calculate the average ratings each movie has received.
